//! Outbound message rate limiter (#950).

use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, PoisonError};
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

/// Caps how fast a client sends messages to TWS / IB Gateway.
///
/// TWS limits the messages an API client may send (IBKR documents 50 per
/// second, rejecting the excess with error 100 and possibly disconnecting a
/// session that keeps exceeding it). The library enforces nothing unless a
/// limiter is installed with `ClientBuilder::rate_limiter`. With one installed,
/// a message over the budget is delayed, never rejected: the sync client
/// blocks the sending thread, the async client awaits without blocking the
/// runtime.
///
/// # What is counted
///
/// Every message the client sends after the connection handshake: requests,
/// orders and cancels. The handshake itself, including reconnects, is not.
///
/// Cancels (`Cancel*` messages, the global order cancel) count against the
/// budget but are sent at once, so unwanted data stops immediately and the
/// next request takes the delay. Cancels expressed as a request with an off
/// flag, such as account updates with `subscribe = false`, wait like requests.
///
/// # The limit
///
/// [`per_second(n)`](Self::per_second) sends at most `n` messages in any
/// one-second window: a small burst goes out at once, the rest at an even
/// pace. Sending cancels can briefly go above `n`; the requests after them
/// wait it out. [`Default`] is `per_second(50)`, IBKR's documented rate.
///
/// IBKR ties the rate to market-data lines (about lines / 2 per second), so
/// accounts with booster packs may allow more. The API does not report an
/// account's lines, so set a higher `n` yourself if yours allows it. A limit
/// that is too low only delays requests.
///
/// # Sharing
///
/// IBKR applies the limit to all clients of one TWS / IB Gateway together.
/// Clones of a limiter share one budget, so pass clones to every client
/// connected to the same gateway. Sync and async clients can share one.
///
/// An async send that is cancelled while waiting (dropped by a timeout, say)
/// still uses its slot.
///
/// Historical-data pacing (error 162) and market-data lines (error 101) are
/// separate limits this does not enforce.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// # #[cfg(feature = "async")]
/// # async fn run() -> Result<(), ibapi::Error> {
/// use ibapi::{Client, RateLimiter};
///
/// // Two clients on one gateway, 50 messages per second between them.
/// let limiter = RateLimiter::default();
/// let trading = Client::builder()
///     .address("127.0.0.1:4002")
///     .client_id(100)
///     .rate_limiter(limiter.clone())
///     .connect()
///     .await?;
/// let research = Client::builder()
///     .address("127.0.0.1:4002")
///     .client_id(101)
///     .rate_limiter(limiter)
///     .connect()
///     .await?;
/// # drop((trading, research));
/// # Ok(())
